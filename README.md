# DKE-Project Group 23

How to get started:
 - [read trough project description, pay specific attention to highlights](https://github.com/Isinlor/DKE-Project/blob/master/project%201-1.pdf)
 - Install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). GitHub will help us efficiently cooperate on code i.e. keep track of changes, merge changes, keep track of issues. Git itself is quite complex, but GitHub Desktop and Web should make it digestible.
 
 I have already added to the repository [the skeleton](https://github.com/Isinlor/DKE-Project/blob/master/ReadGraph.java) made [by Steven](http://skelk.sdf-eu.org/graphcolouring2018/) as well as [example graphs](https://github.com/Isinlor/DKE-Project/tree/master/graphs).
 
 I have also made a list of issues to guide the project.
